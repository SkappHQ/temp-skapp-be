<div>
    <p>
        Your {{leaveType}} leave request from {{leaveStartDate}} to {{leaveEndDate}} has been updated, as
        {{organizationName}} has declared {{holidayDate}} a company holiday ({{holidayName}}).
    </p>

    <p>
        Your leave balance will be adjusted accordingly, and the revised duration of your leave request is now
        {{revisedDuration}} days.
